#  Strava Running Descriptive Analysis

##  Project Background

I've been running casually over the past three years, recording all of my runs through the Strava app. Recently I have signed up for a marathon in April 2026, and now I need to start thinking about a marathon training plan.

To make the most effective plan, I want to run a descriptive analysis on my Strava running data to get a view on my current running level.

Using these findings, I'll have an accurate baseline to pass on to a running coach, or to start to build a marathon training plan as a future project.

##  Areas of Focus

### 1. Volume & Consistency
- Total distance run
- Frequency of runs

### 2. Run Type Distribution
- Overall % distribution of high-effort / low-effort / easy-run
  definitions:
    - high-effort: fast pace relative to distance
    - low-effort: non-fast pace relative to distance
    - easy run: deliberate controlled slow pace

### 3. Speed & Performance
- Average pace on high-effort runs
- Fastest pace achieved
- Fastest 5K / 10K / 15K times

##  Methodology

### 1. Download Data from Strava
- Export raw Strava data
- Select only the relevant fields for analysis

### 2. Clean & Transform Data Using SQL
- Perform all data cleaning and transformations using SQL

### 3. Visualise Data in Power BI
- Handle all data visualisation exclusively in Power BI
